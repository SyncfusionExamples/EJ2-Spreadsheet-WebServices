EJ2 Spreadsheet component web services

## üìò Example Repository ‚Äì Hosting Open and Save Services

This repository demonstrates how to host and integrate Open and Save services for the EJ2 Spreadsheet component using ASP.NET Core and Docker. These examples are intended for developers building secure, scalable, and production-ready spreadsheet applications without relying on demo endpoints.

## üöÄ Overview

The EJ2 Spreadsheet allows users to view, edit, and manage Excel-like data directly in the browser. While demo endpoints (`openUrl` and `saveUrl`) are useful for showcasing features, they are not suitable for production due to limitations in security, scalability, and customization.

This repository offers a self-hosted solution using ASP.NET Core Web API and Docker, giving developers full control over file handling, data privacy, and performance.

## üîß How It Works

The Open and Save services are powered by the `XlsIO` library on the server side:

- **Open Service**: Accepts an uploaded Excel file, reads it on the server, and converts it into a JSON workbook format that the Spreadsheet component can render on the client.
- **Save Service**: Receives the modified JSON workbook from the client, converts it back into an Excel file, and returns it for download.

All operations are performed in memory during the request lifecycle, ensuring no data is persisted on the server.

## üì¶ Features

- Host your own Open and Save services using ASP.NET Core.
- Docker support for containerized deployment.
- Full control over data flow and file processing.
- Enhanced security and privacy for enterprise applications.
- Compatible with the Spreadsheet‚Äôs `openUrl` and `saveUrl` configuration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `WebAPI` folder and configure the ASP.NET Core project.
3. Update the Spreadsheet component‚Äôs `openUrl` and `saveUrl` to point to your hosted endpoints.
4. Run the project locally or deploy it using Docker.

## üß† Best Practices

- Avoid using demo endpoints in production.
- Always validate and sanitize uploaded files.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Monitor and log service usage for auditing and debugging.
